### Key Features
- Like/Unlike posts (with self-like prevention)
- Add comments to posts
- Delete comments (own comments or comments on own posts)
- Check like status and counts
- Pagination for comments
- Soft delete for comments
- Proper permission controls

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Models

### Like Model
```python
class Like(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='likes')
    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='likes')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('user', 'post')
        ordering = ['-created_at']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['post', '-created_at']),
            models.Index(fields=['user', '-created_at']),
        ]
    
    def clean(self):
        """Prevent users from liking their own posts"""
        if self.user == self.post.author:
            raise ValidationError("Users cannot like their own posts.")
```

### Comment Model
```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['created_at']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['post', 'created_at']),
            models.Index(fields=['user', '-created_at']),
            models.Index(fields=['is_active', 'created_at']),
        ]
    
    def can_edit(self, user):
        return user == self.user
    
    def can_delete(self, user):
        return user == self.user or user == self.post.author
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Like System
- **Unique Constraints**: One like per user per post
- **Self-Like Prevention**: Users cannot like their own posts
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Likes are deleted when posts are deleted
- **Efficient Counting**: Uses database relationships for accurate counts

### Comment System
- **Soft Delete**: Comments are marked inactive rather than deleted
- **Permission Control**: Users can delete their own comments or comments on their posts
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large comment lists
- **Content Validation**: Proper content validation and sanitization

### Permission System
- **Like Permissions**: Any authenticated user can like posts (except their own)
- **Comment Permissions**: Any authenticated user can comment on posts
- **Delete Permissions**: Users can delete their own comments or comments on their posts

## üîß Error Handling

### Common Error Responses
- **400 Bad Request**: Validation errors, duplicate likes, self-likes
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid authentication
- **403 Forbidden**: Permission denied for comment deletion
- **404 Not Found**: Post or comment doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side issues

### Error Response Format
```json
{
    "detail": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (post, user, created_at)
- Efficient pagination with proper ordering
- Computed properties for counts
- Unique constraints for data integrity

### Query Optimization
- Selective field loading for large datasets
- Proper use of select_related for foreign keys
- Efficient filtering and ordering

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Comment Replies**: Nested comment system
2. **Comment Editing**: Edit own comments
3. **Comment Moderation**: Admin moderation tools
4. **Like Reactions**: Different types of reactions (heart, thumbs up, etc.)
5. **Comment Notifications**: Notify post authors of new comments
6. **Comment Analytics**: Comment engagement metrics

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching**: Redis-based caching for like/comment counts
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live engagement updates
3. **Search Enhancement**: Full-text search in comments
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam likes/comments
5. **Content Filtering**: Automated content moderation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations engagement
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Test Endpoints
```bash
# Like a post
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/engagement/posts/1/like/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

# Check like status
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/engagement/posts/1/like-status/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

# Add a comment
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/engagement/posts/1/comments/create/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Great post!"}'

# List comments
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/engagement/posts/1/comments/

# Delete comment
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/engagement/posts/1/comments/1/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

## üìù Notes

1. **Like Constraints**: Users cannot like their own posts
2. **Comment Permissions**: Flexible deletion permissions (own comments or comments on own posts)
3. **Soft Delete**: Comments use soft delete to maintain data integrity
4. **Pagination**: Comments are paginated for performance
5. **Real-time Counts**: Like and comment counts are computed dynamically
6. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
7. **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
8. **Security**: Proper authentication and permission checks
9. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and status codes
10. **Scalability**: Designed for high-traffic applications

## üîó Integration with Posts System

The Engagement system integrates seamlessly with the Posts system:

- **Post Model**: Extended with `like_count` and `comment_count` properties
- **API Consistency**: Follows the same patterns as the Posts API
- **Data Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships between models
- **Permission System**: Consistent with the overall application permissions
- **Error Handling**: Unified error response format

## üìà Analytics and Metrics

The system provides several engagement metrics:

- **Like Count**: Number of likes on a post
- **Comment Count**: Number of active comments on a post
- **User Engagement**: Track user's likes and comments
- **Post Popularity**: Measure post engagement through likes and comments

These metrics can be used for:
- Content recommendation algorithms
- User engagement analysis
- Post performance tracking
- Community insights and analytics
